# m8_common.py — shared ops for the m8 batch (飞书「基线用例」base
# EDUAbYWcbaL2HOsgFM1cXmBpn5f, table tblvh0eGrID9JQ02: Fit view #16-#19,
# official color dialog #44-#48/#55-#59, temperature-mixing gate #111/#112,
# purifier gcode #113/#114/#122/#126-#129, high-flow nozzle #133/#135/#136).
#
# Ops are composed from the primitives the older milestones proved:
#   - filament slots are a 2-column grid of [chip][combo][picker] triples
#     (measured 09-17 on the mixed fixture: slot1 combo [38,410,178,440],
#     picker [183,413,199,436], slot2 combo [236,410,388,440])
#   - preset combos are SELF-DRAWN: popup rows probed at the m3e 28px pitch
#     with GetWindowText readback (m3e.switch_preset contract)
#   - the color picker is a 20 DIP bitmap button (clr_picker) next to each
#     combo; ChangeExtruderColor opens the OFFICIAL FilamentColorDialog only
#     for Snapmaker-named presets (PresetComboBoxes.cpp:1067) and falls back
#     to the legacy wx colour dialog otherwise
#   - the Fit camera button is the ImGui FitCameraButtonWindow (GLCanvas3D
#     :7050, tooltip "Fit in all view"); ZoomToFit() (:2824): selection ->
#     zoom_to_selection, assemble canvas -> zoom_to_volumes, else
#     zoom_to_bed. On the maximized rig it sits at client
#     (VIEWPORT_X0+152, height-44) — measured by diag_m8_probe (09-17,
#     blob area 39k -> 424k on click)
#   - purifier gcode comes from the U1 machine start template:
#     SET_PURIFIER_MODE MODE=3 DESIRE_TEMP=45 ... DELAY_OFF=600 (keep-warm),
#     MODE=1 DESIRE_TEMP=42 ALARM_TEMP=45 DELAY_OFF=0 (strong), MODE=3
#     DESIRE_TEMP=0 ... DELAY_OFF=600 (weak) — mode derived in
#     GCode.cpp:2722 from temperature_vitrification (<=50 strong, <=70
#     weak, high-temp filaments skip -> keep-warm)

    STRUCTURAL, not band-based: the numbered chips are found by their text
    ('1'..'5', a small button), and each row's combo / legacy picker is matched
    by sharing the chip's row (same centre y, to the right of the chip). The
    previous version scoped rows with the 'Filaments' label + a fixed y band and
    an x<425 filter calibrated on the 1200x800 window — under the MAXIMIZED
    layout (1920x1080) that band matched only ONE row (measured 09-28: slots ==
    [(5, ...)]), so every slot lookup failed.

    It also computed `picker` OUTSIDE the per-chip loop, so every slot was
    handed the LAST row's rectangle — that is why clicking slot 2's colour
    control opened the wrong thing (leading, via the legacy Edit menu, to the
    native colour picker instead of the official library).

    `swatch` is the numbered chip itself: its background is the filament colour
    and, for Snapmaker presets, clicking it opens the OFFICIAL colour library
    (probe 09-28: chip '2' -> popup carrying 'Official Filaments' / 'sku
    34205'). `picker` is the 16x25 button to its right, whose click opens the
    legacy Edit/Delete/Merge #32768 menu.
