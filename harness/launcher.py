#   - ORCA_GUI_TEST_MODE is REMOVED from the child env (it hides the window —
#     GUI_App.cpp skips mainframe->Show(true) in test mode; a vision driver
#     needs the window visible).
#   - isolation comes from --datadir pointing at a seeded sandbox profile
#     (see profile.py), never from the user's real datadir.
#   - a 3mf/stl passed as `model` is auto-loaded by the app's own startup
#     file-loading path (GUI_App::post_init -> plater()->load_files).

# subsequent click (measured 09-03: the preset-pack "Configuration update"
# dialog poisoned a full 36-case batch to PASS=14 FAIL=22, hot rerun 1/21).
# The sweep below closes them inside the launch sequence, BEFORE any case
# interaction — dialogs raised by a case are never in scope. Matching is by
# window TITLE (en_US; the seeded conf pins the locale) and deliberately
# narrow — the force-upgrade dialog closes the app on ANY button
# (GUI_App.cpp EVT_ENTER_FORCE_UPGRADE -> DownloadDialog, title "Snapmaker
# Orca needs an update") and must never match:
#   "Configuration update"          — MsgUpdateConfig, preset-pack prompt
#   "New version of Snapmaker Orca" — UpdateVersionDialog, app-version
#     prompt (boot_probe phase b drove the REAL dialog via a synthetic
#     feed and WM_CLOSEd it: app survives — close_test 09-03)
#   "Snapmaker Orca Update"         — MsgUpdateSlic3r (dead code in this
#     build; kept for symmetry with boot_probe's classification)
# Blocker appearance timing (census v2, 09-03, measured post-main-window,
# wizard dismissed at t=10s): config dialog t=15s, version dialog t=12s.
# The sweep budget therefore defaults to 25s (dismissal tolerance to ~19s);
# 15s was the pre-census guess and the config dialog lands EXACTLY at its
# edge when the wizard close runs late.

    Cancel (no DPIDialog close veto in UpdateDialogs.cpp), so nothing gets
    installed. Each hit sleeps 2s before re-polling so a re-pop within the
    budget still gets seen; when the budget expires the sweep is over and
