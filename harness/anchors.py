# anchors.py — named UI-locator asset registry (STRUCTURING_PLAN 第二期 #1).
#
# Single home for the things a UI change can break: template images, tab
# color probes, viewport geometry, named dialog regions, and the shared
# match machinery. Case scripts import from here; they must not carry
# scattered coordinates/thresholds. The companion smoke case
# tests/m0_anchor_health.py boots the app and matches every idle-boot
# anchor, so a UI change surfaces as a 5-minute failure list instead of
# 35 red cases.
#
# Scope: anything DUPLICATED across cases or calibrated against the app UI
# (templates, colors, regions, reused thresholds) lives here. Single-use
# case-local numbers stay in the case (over-abstraction hurts review).
# Harness-internal calibrated bands (process_panel/topbar_util internals)
# are already the organized home and stay there.
#
# The ANCHORS table at the bottom is the machine-readable view (consumed by
# m0_anchor_health); the module-level names are the import-friendly
# projections. Keys are stable IDs — never rename (same rule as cases.py).
