# host_guard.py — enforce "cases run on the guest VM" (README top discipline).
#
# The batch discipline (README "跑批纪律与收尾") says regression cases and
# probes run inside the Hyper-V guest (win11-test, via runner/hv_go.ps1);
# direct host execution is dev-only and must be explicitly allowed. This is
# the mechanical half of that rule: launcher.launch() refuses to start the
# app on a host unless ORCA_BB_ALLOW_HOST is set.
#
# Guest detection needs no hardcoded machine names: Hyper-V guests expose
# HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Virtual Machine\Guest\Parameters (the key does not
# exist on a host). Historical violations this guard exists for (README
# discipline section, baseline): 09-02 / 09-08 / 09-16 / 09-17 — the agent
# kept running the suite on the host until told otherwise.
